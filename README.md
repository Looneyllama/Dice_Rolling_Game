# Dice_Rolling_Game
An assignment for my Python coding class.

Write a program that simulates a dice game where the player rolls two dice and calculates the sum of their values. If the sum is 7 or 11, print "You win!" If the sum is 2, 3, or 12, print "You lose!" Otherwise, print "Roll again."

This is an intro class so most of my assignments are very bare bones, but it's still good practice.
